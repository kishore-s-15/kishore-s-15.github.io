Hello World! I'm a graduate student pursuing MS in Artificial Intelligence from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston.

Previously, I've worked as a Machine Learning Engineer and Team Lead at an IIT-Madras Incubated Startup, where I've built end-to-end data-driven software applications from business requirements collection to development and deployment to solve real-world problems.

My research areas of interest include Statistical Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Multimodal Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.

I'm actively looking for ML-based research-oriented Co-op and Full-time opportunities.
