Hi there! I'm a graduate student pursuing MS in Artificial Intelligence from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston. As a Graduate Research Assistant under Prof. Malihe Alikhani and Dr. Resmi Ramachandranpillai, I developed a multimodal, multi-label classifier for clinical decision-making tasks using Electronic Health Records data and mitigated the intersectional biases using a heterogenous bagging method.

I also served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the courses CS 4100 & CS 5100 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, guiding students on topics like Search, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, and AI Ethics. I've also developed assignments focused on de-biasing techniques and building trustworthy DL models through adversarial training, explaining Black-box ML models through SHAP and Knowledge Distillation for Image classification.

Previously, I've worked as a Full-stack Data Scientist at an IIT-Madras Incubated Startup, where I've built end-to-end data-driven software applications from business requirements collection to development and deployment to solve real-world problems.

My research areas of interest include Adversarial Machine Learning, Deep Generative Modeling, Deep Learning and Multimodal Machine Learning. Currently, I am collaborating with Prof. Predrag Radivojac on Membership Inference Attack algorithms for human genomics classifiers.

I'm actively looking for ML-based research-oriented Full-time opportunities starting May 2025.
