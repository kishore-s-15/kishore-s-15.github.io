Hi there! I'm a graduate student pursuing MS in Artificial Intelligence from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston. During my tenure, I got the opportunity to assist Prof. Raj Venkat as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the Founndations of Artificial Intelligence course. Additionally, I've also worked as a Graduate Student Researcher under the guidance of Prof. Malihe Alikhani and Dr. Resmi Ramachandranpillai on building a fair multimodal clinical descision making classifiers using Heterogenous bagging based bias mitigation strategy. I'm currently working under the guidance of Prof. Predrag Radivojac on performing Membership Inference Attacks on classifiers built on Human Genomics data. 

Previously, I've worked as a Full-stack Data Scientist at an IIT-Madras Incubated Startup, where I've built end-to-end data-driven software applications from business requirements collection to development and deployment to solve real-world problems.

My research areas of interest include Statistical Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep Generative Modeling and Multimodal Deep Learning.

I'm actively looking for ML-based research-oriented Full-time opportunities.
